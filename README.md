# Generate images based on the smallNorb dataset.
## Description
This project was created as part of the [opencampus.sh](https://edu.opencampus.sh/) course [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://edu.opencampus.sh/courses/250).

The goal was to train a neural network with the smallNorb dataset and afterwards generate images similar to those in the original dataset.
